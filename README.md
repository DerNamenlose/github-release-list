# GitHub Release List

This is a small [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) demo project developed as
a live coding example for my [Svelte introduction talk](https://dernamenlose.github.io/github-release-list/).

This is by no means production-ready code (for starters: it triggers a
`fetch` on every keystroke, running into the 60/h rate limit of the
GitHub API *pretty* quickly). It merely serves as an example of the basic
anatomy of a Svelte component/application.
